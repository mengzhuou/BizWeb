1. [ ] Login page: Allows employee(including manager) login to the website. Ask for username, password. When textfields are all empty, it cannot be logged in. When authentification failed, have a alert window "Sorry, either your username or password is incorrect.". Improve the CSS. 
2. [ ] Logout: Provide a logout option in the top right of nav bar, users will be logged out without access to tabs that need credentials, and will be navigated to the welcome page
3. [ ] Register client page: Show alert window for whether client is registered successfully or not. Can't register client again if client email already exist. If successful, clear the textfield and re-direct to Client page. 
4. [ ] CSS for frontend pages: sync current frontend pages with Figma. 
5. [x] Menu page: after logging in, users will see three button options: Register a new client, Look up an existing client, Direct project
6. [ ] Management page: Contains options: Register an employee, Remove an employee, Removes a client  
7. [ ] Register an employee page: Test if you can log in using the credential you just registered. 
8. [ ] Remove an employee page: enter employee's fname, lname. Have a Remove button. When remove is clicked, show a warning message: "employee is successdully deleted." 
9. [ ] Direct project page: has project 1, project 2, project 3 options. 
10. [ ] Existing client page: employee needs to fill out ONE of the options to search: Name, Birthday, Phone Number. The search function will read the input of testfield and generate Search output simultaneously. Show a warning message as an output if both conditions are met: 1. at least one of textfield is filled. 2. client does not exist in our database. 
11. [ ] Get client(s) from searching: in the backend, based on input (firstname, lastname), return client(s) id, firstname, lastname, birthday. in the frontend, search results display like a Table in the bottom of the page after the search button is clicked. Displayed client(s) search result in the table, columns include firstName, lastName, birthday. Client rows are clickable, that will bring user to selected Client page.
12. [ ] Remove a client function: needs client id to remove the client. 
13. [ ] Display client page: display client's information and allows for edition. Have these buttons ready - Edit, Save, Cancel. When user clicks Edit, edit button disappeared, Save and Cancel button appearred. The information becomes textfield that stores those information. Changes will not be saved until Save is clicked. Clicking cancel will cancel all changes.
14. [ ] Removes a client page: Manager is able to search client based on client "id" or "first name and last name and birthday". Show search result. Have a Remove button. Prompt a Are You Sure model to confirm or cancel this action. 
15. [ ] Make the top nav bar in its own class: Edit the bottom nav bar to locate on the top. We will add more elements into TopNavBar in the future such that manager can see what normal employees cannot see, we also want to make code consistent and simple. Ex: Display "Manage" button only when Manager logged-in in the top nav bar.
